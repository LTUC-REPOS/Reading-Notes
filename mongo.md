# Mongo and Mongoose

<br><br>

## five differences between SQL and NoSQL databases:

<br>

> 1.  __SQL databases are primarily__   || __NoSQL database are primarily called as non-relational or distributed database__

<br>

> 2.  __SQL databases are table based__ ||   __NoSQL databases are document based, key-value pairs__

<br>

> 3. __SQL databases have predefined schema__  || __NoSQL databases have dynamic schema for unstructured data.__

<br>

> 4. __SQL databases are vertically scalable__  || __NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable__

<br>


> 5. __SQL databases uses structured query language for defining and manipulating the data__  || __NoSQL database, queries are focused on collection of documents__

<br>


<br>


## What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?

<br>



> SQL DB's are more suited for strict and unique data, were data can be filterd easily, and reapted information could cause problems

<br>


## Give a real world example.

<br>



<br>

> In SQL data stored in tables, and tables have relationships (1:1  1:n  n:n), realtionships are built using "Forigen keys", were it ables you to filter the data

<br>

## What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?

<br>

> NoSQL database fits better for the hierarchical data storage as it follows the key-value pair way 

<br>

## Give a real world example.

<br>

> Large JSON object

<br>

## Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?

<br>

> NoSQL

<br>

## Which type of database is best for scalability?

<br>

> NoSQL

<br>



## What does SQL stand for?

<br>

> Structured Query Language

<br>

## What is a relational database?

<br>

> Database that has tables, it tables are connected with each other based on unique identifiers

<br>

## What type of structure does a relational database work with?

<br>

> Tables

<br>

## What is a 'schema'?

<br>

> Some DBMS refers to it as the structer of the table, and some refers to it as the database itself

<br>

## What is a NoSQL database?

<br>

> Document based databases 

<br>

## How does it work?

<br>

> It stores the data in objects

<br>

## What is inside of a Mongo database?

<br>

> Collections instead of tables, each collection represnt data entity

<br>

## Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why.

<br>

> SQL is a language, MongoDB is a NoSql database 

<br>

> NoSQL databases are more flexible, because it data can change it form at any time, also it  scaleable horztinaly

<br>

## What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database?

<br>

> Data Redunduncy 

<br>

> Data consistancy 

<br>
