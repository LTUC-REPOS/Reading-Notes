# What is Tailwind CSS? 

<br>

> Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework designed to enable users to create applications faster and easier. You can use utility classes to control the layout, color, spacing, typography, shadows, and more to create a completely 
> custom component design — without leaving your HTML or writing a single line of custom CSS.

### Example : <br>

``` <button class="h-10 px-6 font-semibold rounded-md bg-black text-white" type="submit">Buy now</button> ```

The HTML contains six utility classes. Let’s break down each one below:

- h-10:  This class sets the button to a fixed height of 10 units.
- px-6: This class sets the horizontal padding of the button to 6 units.
- font-semibold: This class sets the font weight of the button to semibold.
- rounded-md: This class sets the border radius of the button so it has rounded corners.
- bg-black: This class sets the background color of the button to black.
- text-white: This class sets the text color of the button to white.

# Why Tailwind CSS? <br>

>  Tailwind doesn’t offer fully styled components like buttons, dropdowns, and navbars. 
>  Instead, it offers utility classes so you can create your own reusable components.

#  WHAT IS NEXT.JS?                     

<br>

> Next.js is a JavaScript framework that enables you to build superfast and extremely user-friendly static websites, as well as web applications using React.
> In fact, thanks to Automatic Static Optimization, “static” and “dynamic” become one now.
> This feature allows Next.js to build hybrid applications that contain both server-side rendered and statically generated pages.

> Statically generated pages are still reactive: Next.js will hydrate your application client-side to give it full interactivity.

# Advantages <br>

- Rich User Experience (easier and faster)
- Great performance (also easier and faster)
- Rapid feature development
