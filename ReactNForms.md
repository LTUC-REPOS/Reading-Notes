# React And Forms & Ternary Operator

<br><br>

# What is a ‘Controlled Component’?

<br>

> An input form element whose value is controlled by React 

<br>


# Should we wait to store the users responses from the form into state when they submit the form OR should we update the state with their responses as soon as they enter them? Why.

<br>

> I think we need to wait the user to submit the form , then validate its data , and take actions

<br>


# How do we target what the user is entering if we have an event handler on an input field?

<br>

> onChange Event listener gets invoked whenever an input changes

<br>

 

# Why would we use a ternary operator?

<br>

### Shorter Code 
### Readability

<br>


# Rewrite the following statement using a ternary statement:

<br>

> (x===y) ? console.log(true) : console.log(false)
