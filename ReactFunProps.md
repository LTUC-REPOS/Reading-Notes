<br>

<br>

## What is the spread operator?

<br>

> Syntactic sugar to expand array or objects

<br>


## List 4 things that the spread operator can do.

<br>



###  1. Copying an array

###  2. Concatenating arrays

## Give an example of using the spread operator to combine two arrays.

<br>

>  [ *Array1* , ... *Array2* ] 

 > [ ...[1,2,3] , ...[4,5,6]  ] // [1,2,3,4,5,6] 

<br>

## Give an example of using the spread operator to add a new item to an array.

<br>

>  [ *element* , ... *Array* ] 

 > [ 1,2,3 , ...[4,5,6]  ] // [1,2,3,4,5,6]

 > { ...{ id: 1    }  , ...{ name: "a"}  }  // {id:1 , name : 'a'}
