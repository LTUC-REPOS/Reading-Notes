# Introduction to React and Components

<br>

##  __What is a Component__ ?
<br>

<p> A component is a modular, and reusable set of well-defined functionaulty.
 Components let you spult the UI into independent, reusable pieces, and think about each piece in isolation.</p>
<br>

 <p>A React component can be either “stateful” or “stateless”. <br>
 "Stateful" components are of the class type, while “stateless” components are of the function type </p>

<br>

 ##  __What are the characteristics of a component?__
 
 <br>
 <ol>

 <ul>Reusabiulty − Components are usually designed to be reused in different situations and appulcations. </ul>

<br>

 <ul>Replaceable − Components may be freely substituted with other similar components.</ul>

 <br>

 <ul>Not context specific − Components are designed to operate in different environments and contexts. </ul>
  <br>

 <ul></ul>
  <br>
 <ul>Extensible − A component can be extended from existing components to provide new behavior.</ul>
  <br>
 <ul>Independent − Components are designed to have minimal dependencies on other components.</ul>
 
 </ol>

<br>
<br>

  ##  __What are the advantages of using component-based architecture?__


  
 <br>
 <ol>

 <ul>Reduced cost − The use of third-party components allows you to spread the cost of development and maintenance. </ul>

<br>

 <ul>Lossely Coupled Code − Components may be freely replaced or adjusted easly</ul>

 <br>

 <ul>System maintenance and evolution − Easy to change and update the implementation without affecting the rest of the system.</ul>
  <br>

 <ul>Ease of deployment − As new compatible versions become available, it is easier to replace existing versions with no impact on the other components or the system as a whole.</ul>

  <br>
 <ul>Extensible − A component can be extended from existing components to provide new behavior.</ul>
  <br>
 <ul>Independent − Independency and flexible connectivity of components. Independent development of components by different group in parallel. Productivity for the software development and future software development.</ul>
 
 </ol>

##  __What is “props” short for?__

<br>

<p>is a special keyword in React, which stands for properties, in essence props are Javascript objects which contains keys and values
</p>

<br>
<br>

##  __How are props used in React?__

<br>

<p> Props are used to communicate between Components, it used to pass data to other components, props data supposed to be used in  read only way, which means that are coming from parent should not be minupluated by childs. </p>

<br>
<br>

##  __What is the flow of props?__

<br>

<p> Is a uni-directional flow. From parent to childs. </p>
