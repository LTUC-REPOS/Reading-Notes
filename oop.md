# Classes and Objects

<br><br>


> Objects are an encapsulation of variables and functions into a single entity. Objects get their variables and functions from classes. Classes are essentially a template to create your objects. <br>

> You can create multiple different objects that are of the same class(have the same variables and functions defined). However, each object contains independent copies of the variables defined in the class. <br>

> The __init __() function, is a special function that is called when the class is being initiated. It's used for assigning values in a class. <br>

<br>

# Thinking Recursively in Python

<br>


> Recursively means that the function will continue to call itself and repeat its behavior until some condition is met to return a result.  <br>

> When dealing with recursive functions, keep in mind that each recursive call has its own execution context <br>

> A data structure is recursive if it can be deﬁned in terms of a smaller version of itself. A list is an example of a recursive data structure. <br>

> The recursive function’s structure can often be modeled after the definition of the recursive data structure it takes as an input  <br>

# Python Testing with pytest: Fixtures and Coverage 

<br>

> When you're writing tests, you're rarely going to write just one or two. Rather, you're going to write an entire "test suite", with each test aiming to check a different path through your code. <br>

> Fixture provides a defined, reliable and consistent context for the tests. <br>
 
> Coverage means, you making sure that you've actually tested all of the possible paths through all the functions you made  <br>

> A package called pytest-cov on PyPI used to generate report about the coverage of the functions you made <br>
