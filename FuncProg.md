# Functional Programming

<br><br>


## What is functional programming?

<br>

> Is a programming paradigm and a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs <br>
>It treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data

<br>


## What is a pure function and how do we know if something is a pure function?

<br>

> It returns the same result if given the same arguments

<br>

## What are the benefits of a pure function?

<br>

> Consistent, and predictable

<br>

## What is immutability?

<br>

> Its state cannot change after it’s created

<br>

## What is Referential transparency?

<br>

> A function consistently yields the same result for the same input

<br>




## What is a module?

<br>

> Javascript file, instead of typing everything in one file, we sperate it the different functionalities in different files.

<br>


## What does the word ‘require’ do?

<br>

> Importing/Includes other modules or packages;

<br>

## How do we bring another module into the file the we are working in?

<br>

> by typing : require('./CCCCC') and saving the result of require in a variable;

<br>

## What do we have to do to make a module available?

<br>

> We need to export it by typing : module.export =  * *
