# Data Fetching


## What is SWR?

SWR: stands for stale-while-revalidate, a HTTP cache invalidation strategy popularized by HTTP RFC 5861. It basically means that it performs data fetching in 3 steps:

1. Returns cached data first (stale)
2. Sends the fetch request (revalidate)
3. Returns the up-to-date data

SWR is created by Vercel and one of its advantages is that it is a fast and lightweight package. It is a layer built on top of Fetch API and therefore provides additional features on top of just data fetching. These features include caching, pagination, auto revalidation and more.

## Steps

  * Returns cached data first (stale)
  * Sends the fetch request (revalidate)
  * Returns the up-to-date data
  

### __SWR used for__

When we use Fetch or Axios for data fetching in React, we usually need to show the user some loading message or spinner while data is being fetched. Using SWRâ€™s strategy, the user sees the cached (stale) data first and requests are automatically being cached. Components will always be constantly updated with the most recent data, ensuring UI will always be fast and reactive.

## Features of SWR

  * Fast, lightweight and reusable data fetching
  * Built-in cache and request deduplication
  * Real-time experience
  * Transport and protocol agnostic
  * SSR / ISR / SSG support
  * TypeScript ready
  * React Native
  

### Pagination

One of the most useful features of SWR is that it supports pagination and infinite loading of data.

Instead of having to write your own logic with Fetch or Axios to paginate data or create an infinite loading UI for your app, SWR provides a simple Hook called useSWRInfinite to handle this for you.
