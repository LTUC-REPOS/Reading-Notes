# Whiteboarding + Big O 

<br><br>

## What is Big O?

> Big O Notation is a way to represent how long an algorithm will take to execute <br>

> To measure the efficiency of an algorithm, we need to consider two things: <br>

    Time Complexity: How much time does it take to run completely?
    Space Complexity: How much extra space does it require in the process?



<br>

## Types of Big O complexities:

<br>

<p>

1.  O(1) - Constant time complexity <br>
2.  O(n) - Linear time complexity <br>
3.  O(log n) - Logarithmic time complexity <br>
4.  O(n^2) - Quadratic time complexity <br>

## How to get the Big O for any function?

<br>

> Figure out what is the input in terms of n <br>

> Calculate the operations that get executed in terms of n <br>

> We only intrested in worst case, so keep the highest order only <br>

> Remove all the constant factors <br>



## What is whiteboard interview?

> A technical problem-solving assessment that takes place in real time and typically involves a candidate writing code and sometimes diagrams on a whiteboard while onsite <br>


> Whiteboard coding questions do not accurately mimic the environment that a candidate will usually work inâ€”they have no access to a compiler, editor, or reference material as they normally would <br>


## Your whiteboard should contain:

<br>

> Problem domain <br>

> normal and Edge Cases <br>

> The used Algorithm <br>

> Sudo code <br>
