##  Linked Lists

<br>

<p> 

1. linear data structure like a game of hopscotch: in order to get to the end of the list, we have to go through all of the items in the list  <br>


2. Linked lists are linear data structures  <br>

3. The biggest differentiator between arrays and linked lists is the way that they use memory in our machines <br>

4. Linked list could be simple, double, and circular lists, the type of lists indicats the direction of navigation 
<br>

5. A linked list is made up of a series of nodes, which are the elements of the list. <br>

6. Llinked lists must have a head, because this is effectively the only entry point to the list and all of its elements, and the end of the list isnâ€™t a node points to null, or an empty value.

##  Python names and values

<br>

<p> 

1. Names are reassigned indepently ( Copy by value ) <br>

2. Python is high level language, and it got auto memory manager ( Garbge collector ) <br>

3. Assignment never copies data in python, it intializes a new value, or it copy the refrence  <br>

4. Chaning a variable of value type it means rebinding, but changing a variable of refrence type means mutating <br>

5. Function arguments are assignments, you can pass a value like string or a refrence like object to it.  <br>

6. If you have a function that takes a list as argument and mutate it, it is  recommended to return a new list <br>
