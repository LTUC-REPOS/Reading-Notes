## What is OAuth?

<br>

> OAuth is an authorization mechanism to (allow / give permission) other services on your behalf <br>

> Itâ€™s an open standard for authorization and anyone can implement it. <br>

> OAuth scenarios almost always represent two unrelated sites or services trying to accomplish something on behalf of users <br>



<br>


## Give an example of what using OAuth would look like.

<br>

> Login into website by gmail for example, were the first website has nothing to do with google

<br>

## How does OAuth work? What are the steps that it takes to authenticate the user?

<br>

> Two services or website dont trust each other, wants to communicate <br>

>  First website connects to the second website on behalf of the user, using OAuth <br>

> The second site asks the user (Should i allow the first website?), user prompted to authorize the first website.

>  The second site generates an authorization token with limited access to the first site   <br>


<br>

## What is OpenID?

<br>

> OpenID is for humans logging into machines, OAuth is for machines logging into machines on behalf of humans

<br>


## What is the difference between authorization and authentication?

<br>

> Authentication is validating and verfication process ( prove who you are )   <br>

> Authorization is all about permissions, and what you are allowed to do   <br>
